# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T

# Define variables
principal = 1000      # Principal amount ($1000)
rate = 0.05           # Annual interest rate (5% as decimal)
time = 3              # Time in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
